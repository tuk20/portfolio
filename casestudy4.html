        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was part of the <strong>Google UX Design Professional Certificate</strong> program on Coursera, where I was tasked with designing a mobile app and responsive website for local caterers and businesses as part of the "Design for Social Good" module. The goal was to create a platform that simplifies the process of finding and ordering catering services while supporting local businesses in reaching a broader audience. The project emphasized user-centered design principles, accessibility, and fostering community engagement.</p>

        <!-- The Problem -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Catering is an essential service for events and occasions, but the process of finding and ordering from local caterers is often frustrating and inefficient. Customers struggle to discover reliable local options, while small caterers face significant challenges in marketing their services and competing with larger chains. Limited online resources and reliance on platforms like Facebook make it difficult for caterers to manage orders, communicate with customers, and showcase their offerings effectively. This disconnect creates a gap in the market for a streamlined, user-friendly platform that connects customers with local caterers while supporting the growth of small businesses.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Goal -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of this project was to design a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process of discovering, ordering, and managing catering services from local businesses. By creating a hyperlocal solution, the app aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Empower customers to easily find and order from local caterers.</li>
                <li>Provide caterers with tools to manage orders, customize menus, and communicate with customers.</li>
                <li>Foster a sense of community by supporting small businesses and promoting the local food industry.</li>
                <li>Enhance the local economy by increasing visibility and accessibility for local caterers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Research -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To better understand the needs of both customers and caterers, I conducted user interviews with two local caterers and surveyed potential customers. Key insights included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frustration with Facebook:</strong> Caterers found Facebook inefficient for managing orders and communicating with customers. They wanted a dedicated platform to streamline these processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Desire for Control:</strong> Caterers expressed a need for more control over orders, including the ability to customize menus, accommodate dietary restrictions, and set pricing for special requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Online Presence:</strong> Small caterers struggled to compete with larger chains due to limited resources and exposure. They wanted a platform that prioritized local businesses and provided tools to showcase their offerings.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Personas -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Based on the research insights, I created one primary persona that addresses the pain points of both caterers and customers. This persona represents a local caterer who is looking to expand their customer base, streamline order management, and provide a seamless experience for customers seeking reliable, high-quality catering options.</p>
          <!--
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Persona 1:</strong> A local caterer looking to expand their customer base and streamline order management.</li>
                <li><strong>Persona 2:</strong> A customer planning an event and seeking reliable, high-quality catering options from local businesses.</li>
            </ul> -->

        <!-- Design Process -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>
            <p>I began by sketching multiple iterations of the mobile app's homepage, focusing on highlighting local caterers as the main attraction. After several rounds of ideation, I combined the best elements into a final paper wireframe.</p>
            <!-- Insert pictures of paper wireframes here -->
            <div class="wireframe-container">
                <div class="wireframe-item">
                    <img src="Katerit_paper_wireframe1.png" alt="Wireframe Example 1" class="content-image">
                </div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Digital Wireframes</h3>
            <p>Using the final paper wireframe as a foundation, I translated the design into a digital format using Figma. I then expanded the design to include other key screens, such as the menu page, order customization page, and checkout flow.</p>
            <!-- Insert pictures of digital wireframes here -->
            <img src="Katerit_digital_wireframes.png" alt="Digital Wireframes" class="content-image">

            <h3>User Flow</h3>
            <p>I mapped out the primary user flow to ensure a seamless experience for both customers and caterers. The flow included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Home: Discovering local caterers.</li>
                <li>Marketplace: Browsing menus and customizing orders.</li>
                <li>Placing and confirming orders.</li>
                <li>Receiving order updates and reminders.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Insert user flow diagram here -->
            <img src="Katerit_user_flow.png" alt="User Flow" class="content-image">

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>To ensure intuitive navigation, I created a sitemap that organized the app's content and features logically. Key sections included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home:</strong> Showcase local caterers with filters for cuisine, budget, and dietary restrictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Menu:</strong> Allow customers to browse and customize catering options.</li>
                <li><strong>Order Management:</strong> Enable caterers to manage orders, update menus, and communicate with customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile:</strong> Provide caterers with tools to create and manage their business profiles.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Prototyping and Testing -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>I developed a low-fidelity prototype to test the core functionality of the app. This included basic interactions such as browsing caterers, customizing orders, and completing the checkout process.</p>
            <!-- Insert images or a link to the low-fidelity prototype here -->

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>I conducted usability testing with 5 participants, including both caterers and customers. Key findings included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users appreciated the simplicity of the interface but requested more filtering options for caterers.</li>
                <li>Caterers wanted clearer instructions for setting up their profiles and menus.</li>
                <li>Some users found the checkout process confusing and suggested adding a progress indicator.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback, I iterated on the design and created a high-fidelity prototype with improved navigation, additional filtering options, and a streamlined checkout process.</p>
            <!-- Insert images or a link to the high-fidelity prototype here -->

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was a rewarding challenge that allowed me to apply UX design principles to a real-world problem. Despite the tight timeline, I was able to deliver a design that met the needs of both customers and caterers. However, there are areas for improvement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating additional personas to represent a wider range of user needs and behaviors. While the single persona I developed addressed key pain points, more personas could have provided deeper insights into diverse user groups, such as customers with specific dietary preferences or caterers with unique business models.</li>
                <li>Conducting more extensive user testing with a larger and more diverse group of participants.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with developers earlier in the process to ensure feasibility and technical alignment.</li>
                <li>Exploring additional features, such as integration with social media and loyalty programs, to further enhance the user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this project reinforced the importance of user-centered design and iterative testing in creating effective solutions.</p>
