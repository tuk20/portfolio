        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was part of the <strong>Google UX Design Professional Certificate</strong> program on Coursera. Inspired by my lifelong learner mom and the challenges faced by immigrants and refugees in my community, I designed <strong>NATURIZE</strong>, a mobile app to help users prepare for the U.S. citizenship test. The app aims to provide a comprehensive, engaging, and personalized learning experience to improve users' chances of passing the naturalization test.</p>
            <p><strong>Project Duration:</strong> 2 weeks (detail breakdown provided in the process section).</p>
            <p>You can view the Figma Hi-fi prototype of the app here → <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/6yDc11C3d4zD6Yv5IuKmEq/NATURIZE?node-id=214-751&t=u32UakMpaSEFoREo-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=214%3A436&starting-point-node-id=214%3A751" target="_blank">Hi-fi Prototype</a>.</p>

        <!-- The Problem -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)</strong> mandates that naturalization applicants pass a test with English and civics components. However, only <strong>88% of applicants pass on their first attempt</strong>, and many immigrants and refugees struggle to pass even on subsequent attempts. Common challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of access to structured and engaging study materials.</li>
                <li>Difficulty managing time and anxiety during preparation.</li>
                <li>Limited personalized feedback to address individual learning gaps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This problem inspired me to create a solution that empowers immigrants and refugees to confidently prepare for and pass the citizenship test.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>I conducted <strong>user interviews</strong> with 2 immigrants and refugees who had taken or were preparing for the citizenship test. Key insights included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users felt overwhelmed by the volume of material to study.</li>
                <li>Many struggled with anxiety and time management.</li>
                <li>Users wanted interactive and engaging ways to learn, such as games and flashcards.</li>
                <li>Personalized feedback and progress tracking were highly desired.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I analyzed existing citizenship test preparation apps and identified gaps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most apps lacked engaging and interactive features.</li>
                <li>Few offered personalized learning paths or social support.</li>
                <li>Many had outdated designs and poor usability.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Maria, 35, Immigrant from Mexico</strong>: Struggles with English proficiency, feels anxious about the test, and has limited time to study due to work and family responsibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Ahmed, 28, Refugee from Egypt</strong>: Finds the civics material overwhelming and lacks access to structured study resources.</li>
            </ul>
