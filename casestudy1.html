        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>As a <strong>Web Developer Intern</strong> at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), I expressed my interest in UX design to my manager and was given the opportunity to lead the redesign of the NAIC Help Page. This project allowed me to combine my technical skills as a developer with my growing passion for UX design. The goal was to improve usability, accessibility, and user engagement while aligning the page with the organization's broader design system—all within a tight 1-2 week deadline.</p>

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The NAIC Help Page faced several usability challenges that hindered its effectiveness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent Design</strong>: The page did not align with the visual and functional consistency of the rest of the NAIC website. Inconsistent layout, and button styles created a disjointed and unprofessional appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Information Architecture</strong>: Overwhelming layout, lack of clear categorization, and small texts made it difficult for users to find relevant information.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Accessibility</strong>: The page was not optimized for mobile devices or accessible to users with disabilities. Issues such as low color contrast, lack of keyboard navigation, and poor responsiveness made it difficult for all users to interact with the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Overload</strong>: The page contained excessive text, redundant information, and unnecessary details, making it difficult for users to quickly scan and extract relevant content.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Visual Hierarchy</strong>:  Important information was buried within long paragraphs, and the absence of distinct headings, bullet points, and clear sectioning forced users to read everything instead of skimming efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Engagement</strong>: High bounce rates indicated user frustration, partly due to unclear calls-to-action (CTAs) and inefficient content organization.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- My Role -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>While my primary role was as a <strong>Web Developer Intern</strong>, I proactively expressed my interest in UX design to my manager. As a result, I was assigned this project to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct user research and gather insights.</li>
                <li>Redesign the Help Page with a focus on usability and accessibility.</li>
                <li>Collaborate with the senior web developer and the entire web team to implement the redesign.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between <strong>development</strong> and <strong>design</strong>, gaining hands-on experience in UX principles while leveraging my technical skills.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Research & Discovery -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>To understand the problem deeply, I conducted the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong>: Collaborated with the head of the web team and senior web developer to align on organizational goals and constraints.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>: Analyzed design patterns across other pages on the NAIC website to ensure consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Analysis of the NAIC Website</strong>: Conducted a thorough review of the entire NAIC website to understand its design system, components, and patterns. This included studying typography, color schemes, button styles, navigation structures, and other UI elements to ensure the new Help Page design would seamlessly integrate with the rest of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>User Testing</strong>: Conducted usability testing sessions with real users to identify pain points and gather feedback on the existing design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users struggled with the cluttered layout and lack of clear navigation.</li>
                <li>Mobile users found the page difficult to use due to poor responsiveness.</li>
                <li>Accessibility issues, such as low contrast and lack of keyboard navigation, hindered usability for users with disabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Design Process -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>The redesign process followed a <strong>user-centered design approach</strong>, focusing on iterative improvements and collaboration with cross-functional teams. To ensure the final design met user needs and business goals, I incorporated <strong>A/B testing</strong> during the wireframing phase.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wireframing</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created two distinct low-fidelity wireframes (<strong>Wireframe Example 1</strong> and <strong>Wireframe Example 2</strong>) to explore different layouts, navigation structures, and content hierarchies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wireframe Example 1</strong> focused on a <strong>card-based layout</strong> with clear visual separation between sections, while <strong>Wireframe Example 2</strong> emphasized a <strong>list-based layout</strong> with compact information density for faster scanning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>A/B Testing with Wireframes</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted A/B testing with a group of 7 stakeholders to compare the effectiveness of the two wireframes.</li>
                        <li>Users were given specific tasks (e.g., finding a specific help topic, navigating to a resource) to complete on both wireframes.</li>
                        <li>Metrics tracked included <strong>ease of navigation</strong>, and <strong>user preference</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Insights from A/B Testing</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wireframe Example 1 (Card-Based Layout)</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users found the card-based layout visually appealing and easier to navigate, especially on mobile devices.</li>
                                <li>However, some users felt it required more scrolling, which could be a drawback for users seeking quick answers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Wireframe Example 2 (List-Based Layout)</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users appreciated the compact design for quick scanning but found it less engaging and slightly overwhelming due to the lack of visual hierarchy.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Based on the feedback, I combined the strengths of both wireframes—using a <strong>hybrid approach</strong> that incorporated the visual appeal of the card-based layout with the efficiency of the list-based structure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>High-Fidelity Prototyping</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a high-fidelity prototype based on the insights from the A/B testing, ensuring the design was both visually engaging and functionally efficient.</li>
                        <li>Conducted additional usability testing sessions with the prototype to gather feedback and iterated on the design.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Worked closely with the senior developer to ensure feasibility and alignment with technical constraints.</li>
            </ul>
